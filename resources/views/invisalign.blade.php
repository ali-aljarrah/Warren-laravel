                        If you're looking for a straight smile without the metal-mouth, clear aligners may be the solution. Invisalign® is a set of transparent (see-through) aligners that fit over your teeth. Unlike traditional metal braces, Invisalign® aligners are removable & replaced every two weeks for the entire course of your treatment.

                        The restrictive brackets & wires of traditional metal braces can trap bits of food & make cleaning your teeth more difficult. If you don’t thoroughly clean your teeth while wearing metal braces, you may end up with stains when they’re removed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="black-color fs-16">
                        With Invisalign®, there is no need for fixed wires & brackets, so you won’t have to worry about food stuck in your braces. Plus you can smile confidently without trying to hide a mouthful of metal! Placing & removing Invisalign® aligners is seamless & convenient, & they can be easily removed before meals or social engagements. Even when you’re wearing them, they are discreet & blend in with your smile.

                            What Is Invisalign®?
                        </h2>
                        <p class="soft-dark fs-16">
                            Invisalign® uses a series of clear aligners to straighten your teeth. Each clear aligner only shifts your teeth slightly, so you need to “upgrade” them every two weeks. You’ll wear around 20 to 30 sets of aligners before your treatment is finished. Some patients need to wear more sets & others need to wear fewer. It all depends on your specific case!

                            It is a powerful tool for treating minor to moderate orthodontic problems. If your problem is severe enough, we may not be able to treat your case with Invisalign® aligners. Traditional metal braces are a reliable alternative that can correct most bite issues. To find out which treatment is best for you, please call for a consultation today!

                            Invisalign® vs. Traditional Braces

                        <p class="black-color fs-16">
                            Removable aligners are handy, but taking them out too frequently can make your treatment more difficult. If you spend too much time without wearing them, you can actually lose progress & increase the time & expense of your Invisalign® treatment. You may even need to go back to wearing an old pair of aligners! Dentists recommend keeping your aligners on for at least 22 hours a day. Only remove them for meals & special occasions, & keep track of the amount of time they aren’t in your mouth. If you tend to be forgetful, you may be better off with traditional braces.

                            As your treatment progresses, each new set will have minor adjustments. You may notice that a new set doesn’t fit quite right at first. This is because your teeth need to shift to fit the aligner’s shape. Invisalign® is a gradual process, so each aligner only moves a few specific teeth at a time. Your dentist or orthodontist will check up on your progress every few weeks & give you new sets of clear aligners based on your current progress.
                        </p>
                        <p class="black-color fs-16">
                            The pressure from the aligner is strong enough to move most teeth, but some may need an extra push. Your dentist or orthodontist can add attachments to help guide your teeth into place. An attachment is made with a small dot of liquid bonding resin that is applied to a specific tooth & hardened with a special curing light. This dot helps make contact with the aligner, applying extra force to teeth that may not shift on their own. Adding & later removing this bonding resin is a simple process that doesn’t require any anesthesia.
