                            What Is SureSmile®?
                        </h2>
                        <p class="soft-dark fs-16">
                            Using a series of clear aligners, SureSmile® helps gradually shift your teeth into place. Clear aligners are transparent (see-through) appliances that fit over your teeth. If you’ve ever received take-home teeth whitening trays, you’ll notice that clear aligners look very similar. SureSmile® aligners are designed to be blend in with your natural teeth, unlike traditional metal braces. They are also removable, so you can take them off before you eat & you won’t need to worry about food getting stuck in them!
                        </p>
                        <p class="soft-dark fs-16 mb-0">
                            You will get a new set of aligners every time you come in for treatment & each set will be slightly different than the last. Instead of moving all the teeth together like traditional metal braces, SureSmile® works by moving your teeth little by little. When you get a new set of aligners, it might feel like it doesn’t fit right. Don’t worry; this is normal! Your teeth need to shift before they will fit into the aligners. Once that happens, it’s time for your next set.
                        </p>

                            This might seem like an inefficient way of moving teeth, but it’s actually more effective than moving them all at once! Because SureSmile® makes targeted adjustments to the alignment of your teeth, you’ll actually need fewer appointments than with other orthodontic appliances. SureSmile®’s faster treatment times are due in large part to advanced software that allows us to track the movement of your teeth with pinpoint accuracy. The days of goopy molds & regular old x-rays are long gone! SureSmile® uses a state-of-the-art digital scanner to create a 3D image of your teeth & gums. This technology gives your dentist maximum control over the treatment process by allowing them to change minor or major details about your aligners. After making any necessary adjustments to each tooth’s movement, your dentist will map out an individual treatment plan to achieve the quickest results.
                        </p>
                        <p class="black-color fs-16">
                            The success of your SureSmile® treatment plan is largely dependent on how compliant you are in wearing your aligners. To get the fastest results, you’ll need to wear your aligners for at least 20–22 hours every day. You may feel tempted to take off your aligners if they feel uncomfortable, but you need to fight this temptation at all costs. Forgetting to wear your aligners will significantly slow down your progress & could cost you extra time & money! For the best outcome, only remove your aligners to eat & for special events.
