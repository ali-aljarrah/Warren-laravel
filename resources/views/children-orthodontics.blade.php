                    Malocclusions, or misalignments of the teeth, can be recognized as early as 2 to 3 years of age. Often, early steps can be taken to reduce the need for major orthodontic treatment at a later age. We can help identify these issues in your child.

While all these are important when caring for kids, they also require special attention in order to feel comfortable & respected. We offer the best of both worlds.

                            Early Treatment: This period of treatment encompasses ages 2 to 6. At this young age, we are concerned with underdeveloped dental arches, the premature loss of primary teeth & harmful habits like thumb-sucking. Treatment initiated in this stage of development is often very successful & many times (though not always) eliminates the need for future orthodontic or orthopedic treatment.

                            Mixed Dentition: This period covers the ages of 6 to 12, when the permanent front teeth (incisors) & 6-year molars come in. Treatment deals with jaw misalignment & dental realignment problems. This is an excellent stage to start treatment, when indicated, as your child’s hard & soft tissues are usually very responsive to orthodontic or orthopedic forces.
