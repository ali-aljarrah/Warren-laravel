                        A tooth that has been knocked out or cracked is perhaps the most critical dental emergency. If your tooth has been knocked out in an accident, seeing a dentist as soon as possible is vital to saving your tooth. In the meantime before you get to the dentist, you can take steps to keep your tooth alive, including gently trying to place the tooth back in its socket (without touching the root), keeping the tooth between your gums & lip, placing it in a glass of milk, or placing it in an

                        Preventing Dental Emergencies

                        There are a few precautions you can take to avoid future dental emergencies. Our most important piece of advice is to treat your teeth with care & respect. You only get one set of permanent teeth! Stopping bad habits like nail biting or chewing on pens & other inedible objects can go a long way in preventing future dental disasters.
                    </p>
                    <p class="black-color fs-16 pt-3">
                        Improvements to your dietary habits can also contribute to dental longevity. Eating ice or hard & sticky candy is rough on your teeth & will wear them down or even loosen them. If certain foods take extra effort to chew, it’s probably best to avoid them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="black-color fs-16 pt-3">
                        Athletes & kids who play sports should always wear protective mouthguards during physical activities. These can be purchased at the store or from a dentist. An athletic mouthguard that fits well is more likely to prevent injuries, so make sure to have a dentist take a look at yours. Even minor teeth shifting can affect how your mouthguard fits.
                    </p>
                    <p class="black-color fs-16 pt-3">
                        If you’re having problems with a store-bought sports mouthguard, the dentist can usually make one that’s better for comfort & protection. After all, you’re more likely to wear a mouthguard when it fits nicely! Get in the habit of bringing your mouthguard to every dental appointment in case it needs adjustment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="black-color fs-16 pt-3">
                        Keeping these tips in mind can save you a lifetime of dental visits & expenses. We’re happy to care for you during a dental emergency, but we’d prefer you avoid one in the first place!
